# Reshaping and summarizing raw data into a tidy data set
In this project I will get data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, data will be transformed, reshaped, summarized, and a tidy data set will be generated, which can be used for later analysis.
The process to generate the tidy data set from the raw data will be performed by a single scrip: run_analysis.R. Details on how to operate with it are below.
